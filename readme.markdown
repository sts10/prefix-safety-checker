# Prefix Safety Checker

This command line tool checks whether a given passphrase word list (such as a diceware word list) has any words that are prefixes of other words on the list. It's written in Rust, which I am new to. This is very much **a work in progress**, so I'd heavily caution against trusting it for real results. 

I've now written [a blog post](https://sts10.github.io/2018/05/05/compound-passphrase-list-safety-checker.html) about this tool.
